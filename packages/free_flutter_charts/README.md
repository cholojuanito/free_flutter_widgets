## Installation

Install the latest version from [pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/free_flutter_charts#-installing-tab-).

## Chart getting started

Import the following package.

```dart
import 'package:free_flutter_charts/charts.dart';
```
### Add chart to the widget tree

Add the chart widget as a child of any widget. Here, the chart widget is added as a child of container widget.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: Container(
          child: SfCartesianChart()
        )
      )
  );
}
```

**Note**

* Use `SfCartesianChart` widget to render line, spline, area, column, bar, bubble, scatter, step line, and fast line charts.
* Use `SfCircularChart` widget to render pie, doughnut, and radial bar charts.
* Use `SfPyramidChart` and `SfFunnelChart` to render pyramid and funnel charts respectively.

### Bind data source

Based on data, initialize the appropriate axis type and series type. In the series, map the data source and the fields for x and y data points. To render a line chart with category axis, initialize appropriate properties.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: Container(
          child: SfCartesianChart(
            // Initialize category axis
            primaryXAxis: CategoryAxis(),

            series: <LineSeries<SalesData, String>>[
              LineSeries<SalesData, String>(
                // Bind data source
                dataSource:  <SalesData>[
                  SalesData('Jan', 35),
                  SalesData('Feb', 28),
                  SalesData('Mar', 34),
                  SalesData('Apr', 32),
                  SalesData('May', 40)
                ],
                xValueMapper: (SalesData sales, _) => sales.year,
                yValueMapper: (SalesData sales, _) => sales.sales
              )
            ]
          )
        )
      )
  );
}

class SalesData {
  SalesData(this.year, this.sales);
  final String year;
  final double sales;
}

```

### Add chart elements

Add the chart elements such as title, legend, data label, and tooltip to display additional information about the data plotted in the chart.

```dart
TooltipBehavior _tooltipBehavior;

@override
void initState(){
  _tooltipBehavior = TooltipBehavior(enable: true);
  super.initState();
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: Container(
          child: SfCartesianChart(

            primaryXAxis: CategoryAxis(),
            // Chart title
            title: ChartTitle(text: 'Half yearly sales analysis'),
            // Enable legend
            legend: Legend(isVisible: true),
            // Enable tooltip
            tooltipBehavior: _tooltipBehavior,

            series: <LineSeries<SalesData, String>>[
              LineSeries<SalesData, String>(
                dataSource:  <SalesData>[
                  SalesData('Jan', 35),
                  SalesData('Feb', 28),
                  SalesData('Mar', 34),
                  SalesData('Apr', 32),
                  SalesData('May', 40)
                ],
                xValueMapper: (SalesData sales, _) => sales.year,
                yValueMapper: (SalesData sales, _) => sales.sales,
                // Enable data label
                dataLabelSettings: DataLabelSettings(isVisible: true)
              )
            ]
          )
        )
      )
  );
}
```

The following screenshot illustrates the result of the above code sample.

![simple line chart](https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/FTControl/simple-line-chart.gif)

## Spark Charts getting started

Import the following package.

```dart
import 'package:free_flutter_charts/sparkcharts.dart';
```

### Add spark charts to the widget tree

Add the spark charts widget as a child of any widget. Here, the spark charts widget is added as a child of container widget.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: Container(
          child: SfSparkLineChart()
        )
      )
  );
}
```

**Note**

Use `SfSparkAreaChart`, `SfSparkBarChart` and `SfSparkWinLossChart` widgets to render area, bar and win-loss charts respectively.

### Bind spark charts data source
Based on data and your requirement, initialize the series and bind the data to sparkline charts.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: Container(
          child: SfSparkLineChart(
              data: <double>[
                1, 5, -6, 0, 1, -2, 7, -7, -4, -10, 13, -6, 7, 5, 11, 5, 3
              ],
            )
        )
      )
  );
}
```

**Note:**  Needs to add the data source to render a spark chart.

### Add spark charts elements

Add the spark charts elements such as marker, data label, and trackball to display additional information about the data plotted in the spark charts.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: Container(
          child: SfSparkLineChart(
              //Enable the trackball
              trackball: SparkChartTrackball(
                  activationMode: SparkChartActivationMode.tap),
              //Enable marker
              marker: SparkChartMarker(
                  displayMode: MarkerDisplayMode.all),
              //Enable data label
              labelDisplayMode: LabelDisplayMode.all,
              data: <double>[
                1, 5, -6, 0, 1, -2, 7, -7, -4, -10, 13, -6, 7, 5, 11, 5, 3
              ],
            )
        )
      )
  );
}
```
