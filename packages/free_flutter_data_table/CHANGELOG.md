## [18.4.49-beta] - 03/23/2021

**Bugs**

* Stack overflow exception is no longer thrown when comparing two DataGridSource class with hashCode.

## [18.4.47-beta] - 03/09/2021

**Bugs**

* Now, if the widget is loaded using the 'headerCellBuilder' function, the padding will not be considered for the column header.

## [18.4.33-beta] - 01/05/2021 

**Bugs**
	
* Now, when moving from a page with fewer rows than the size of the view port, rows are not clipped to another page with more rows than the size of the view port.

## [18.4.31-beta] - 12/22/2020

**Breaking Changes**

* Now, the row index is started from 0 instead of 1 for first row in `onQueryRowStyle` and `onQueryCellStyle` callbacks.

## [18.4.30-beta] - 12/17/2020

**Features**

* Provided the support to show stacked headers i.e. unbound header rows. Unbound header rows span stacked header columns across multiple rows and columns.
* Provided the support to display an interactive view when the grid reaches its maximum offset while scrolling down. Tapping the interactive view triggers a callback to add more data from the data source of the grid at run time.
* Provided the support to highlight the header cells on mouse hover.
* Provided the callbacks support in SfDataPager to listen when page navigation is started and ended.
* Provided the support to set grid lines for header and stacked header cells.
* Provided the support to improve the compactness of the datagrid based on the visual density.

**Breaking Changes**

* All the properties in GridTextColumn, GridNumericColumn, GridDateTimeColumn and GridWidgetColumn classes are marked as final. So, these classes are immutable. 

## [18.3.53-beta] - 12/08/2020

**Bugs**

* Now, the last row is considered to calculate the auto-fit column width.

## [18.3.52-beta] - 12/01/2020

* Provided the support to refresh the specific row's height at run time

**Breaking changes**

* The `isHidden` property has been renamed as `visible` in the `GridColumn` class.
